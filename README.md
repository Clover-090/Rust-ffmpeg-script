This code is, and has always been, written 100% by humans. No generative AI has been or ever will be used to write code in this repo, genAI is only possible by stealing the hard work of other developer so not only is it unehtical to use, it is impossible to create code with it that can exist an run under any license. it creates more problems and work than it prevents, is a huge security risk, and is ultimately a lousey replacement for actually skill and effort.
